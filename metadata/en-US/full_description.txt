An icon pack forked from ICEcons with the goal of providing icons mostly for F-Droid and other FOSS apps.
It was designed to look clean and simple, featuring only white icons and transparency for a see-through effect.
Frost includes support for Trebuchet, KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more launchers.
There are about '''300''' icons, as well as a few '''4K wallpapers''' included.

Submitting icon requests helps a lot, but maintaining the project (as you may imagine) takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about adding new icons.
Contributions for new icons are always welcome, and no experience with programming is necessary.
